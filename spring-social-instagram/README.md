# Spring Social Instagram Example

This sample app demonstrates how to use [spring-social-instagram](https://github.com/mattupstate/spring-social-instagram) and is based on the [spring-social-quickstart](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-samples/tree/master/spring-social-quickstart) project.

You should be able to run this application locally by performing the following steps:

#### Clone the project from github if you haven't already: 

    git clone git@github.com:mattupstate/spring-social-instagram-example.git

#### Run the project using the Maven Tomcat plugin:

    mvn tomcat:run

At the moment, the project simply displays the first page of your feed. I'll be adding more API call examples in the future.

Or perhaps you'd like to fork this and have at it yourself to test out the API! I'd love some feedback.
